# Comprehensive ESP32 MicroPython Setup & Project Guide (Custom for You)

This personalized guide will walk you through everything you've done so far with your ESP32 board and MicroPython: from installation, flashing, handling errors, to testing sensors using Thonny IDE and esptool. Save or print this for future reference.

---

## üß∞ What You Need

* An **ESP32 board** (e.g. ESP32-DevKit, NodeMCU)
* A **USB cable**
* A computer with:

  * **Python 3.7+ installed**
  * **Thonny IDE**
  * **esptool** and optionally `mpremote`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Install Required Tools

### üî∏ Install Python (if not already)

* [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install with the "Add to PATH" option checked

### üî∏ Install esptool

```bash
pip install esptool
```

### üî∏ Install mpremote (optional but helpful)

```bash
pip install mpremote
```

### üî∏ Install Thonny IDE

* Download from [https://thonny.org](https://thonny.org)
* Run installer and open Thonny
* Go to `Tools > Options > Interpreter`

  * Select **MicroPython (ESP32)**
  * Choose the appropriate **COM port**

---

## üîÅ Step 2: Flash MicroPython to ESP32

### üî∏ Download Firmware

* Go to [https://micropython.org/download/esp32](https://micropython.org/download/esp32)
* Download the **generic** `esp32-*.bin` file (not SPIRAM or OTA)

### üî∏ Erase Existing Firmware

```bash
esptool.py --port COM8 erase_flash
```

*Your Output:*

```
Found 2 serial ports
... Chip is ESP32-D0WD-V3 ...
Erasing flash... completed successfully
```

‚úÖ Flash was successfully erased.

### üî∏ Flash New Firmware

```bash
esptool.py --port COM8 --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 esp32-202XXXXXX-vX.X.X.bin
```

---

## üîç Step 3: Verify and Explore ESP32 with MicroPython

Open Thonny and connect to your ESP32:

* Select COM port in **Run > Select Interpreter**
* Choose **MicroPython (ESP32)**
* Click the `>>>` REPL prompt

### üî∏ Test Commands:

```python
import os, esp, gc
print(esp.flash_size())      # Flash size (in bytes)
print(os.uname())            # Board/system info
print(gc.mem_free())         # Free RAM
```

*Example Output:*

```python
4194304
(sysname='esp32', ..., machine='Generic ESP32')
149008
```

‚úÖ You now have MicroPython running on your ESP32!

## üå°Ô∏è Step 4: Sensor Examples

### üìå Example 1: DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor

**Wiring**: Connect DHT22 to 3.3V, GND, and GPIO 4

**Code:**

```python
import time
import dht
from machine import Pin

sensor = dht.DHT22(Pin(4))

while True:
    try:
        sensor.measure()
        print("Temp: {:.1f}C, Humidity: {:.1f}%".format(sensor.temperature(), sensor.humidity()))
    except OSError as e:
        print("Sensor error:", e)
    time.sleep(2)
```

### üìå Example 2: ACS712 Current Sensor (Analog Input)

**Wiring**:

* OUT to GPIO 34
* VCC to 5V (with voltage divider if needed)

**Code:**

```python
from machine import ADC, Pin
import time

adc = ADC(Pin(34))
adc.atten(ADC.ATTN_11DB)
VCC = 3.3
MID_V = VCC / 2
SENSITIVITY = 0.185  # V/A

def read_current(samples=100):
    total = 0
    for _ in range(samples):
        total += adc.read() * (VCC / 4095)
        time.sleep_ms(1)
    avg_v = total / samples
    return (avg_v - MID_V) / SENSITIVITY

while True:
    print("Current: {:.2f} A".format(read_current()))
    time.sleep(1)
```

## ‚ùó Errors You Faced and Fixes

### üî∏ Error: "Could not connect to an Espressif device"

**Fix**: You ran `esptool.py erase_flash`, which:

* Found the chip (`ESP32-D0WD-V3`)
* Successfully uploaded stub and erased flash

‚úÖ After that, flashing worked fine.

## üéØ What Can You Do With MicroPython?

| Use Case          | MicroPython Strengths            | Arduino (C++)        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Quick Prototyping | Yes, REPL and easy scripting     | Slower iteration     |
| Web Servers / IoT | Built-in sockets, urequests      | Needs more libraries |
| Real-Time Control | Limited (Python is slower)       | Better for precision |
| File Handling     | Yes (e.g. main.py, logs, config) | Not built-in         |
| Complex Drivers   | May be limited                   | Extensive support    |
| Teaching/Learning | Excellent for Python learners    | More complex         |
